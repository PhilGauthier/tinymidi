*tinymidi* - a small C library for doing MIDI on GNU/Linux
==========

### Abstract ###

On Android, its difficult to work with USB-Midi devices. Even if building your
own ROM and adding kernel-level support for such devices, there is no library to
access those drivers functionality easily as alsa-lib has been removed from
android a while ago and cannot be built against bionic. This small library
intends to provide simple access to such raw Midi device files for read and
writing data to.

## Building ##

Building tinymidi should be straight forward. On GNU/Linux or equivalent, just
run `make` in the project directory. Adding tinymidi to an android project is
slightly more involved, as it requires using the JNI as well as a kernel
configured to include raw MIDI drivers.

### Dependencies: ###

GNU make, gcc, and glibc

### GNU/Linux ###

1) configure the target installation directory by editing `Makefile`

2) run `make`

3) run `sudo make install`

### Android ###

(TODO)

## Usage ##

1) include `tinimidi.h` in your project

2) open a midi device file (e.g. `/dev/midi2`) using `rawmidi_hw_open` (see
tests for more detailed information)

3) read/write from/to the device using `rawmidi_hw_write` & `rawmidi_hw_read`

4) close the device file descriptor using `rawmidi_rw_close`
